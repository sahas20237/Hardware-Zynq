# Hardware Acceleration of Signal Processing Algorithm on a Zynq Architecture
Implemented a Hardware Accelerator for the FFT/IFFT for ZYNQ Z7-10 Board. </br>
Made Verilog modules to test and accelerate signal processing on Vivado Design Suite. </br>
This was a part of Final Lab of course Embedded Logic Design (ECE_270).
