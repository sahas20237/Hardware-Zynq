# Hardware Acceleration of Signal Processing Algorithm on a Zynq Architecture
Implemented a Hardware Accelerator for the FFT/IFFT for ZYNQ Z7-10 Board. </br>
Made Verilog modules to test and accelerate signal processing on Vivado Design Suite. </br>
This was a part of Final Lab of course Embedded Logic Design (ECE_270).

## Project File
Block Diagrams and further explatnation can be found in: </br>
`FFT_Accelerate.pdf`

## Results
Achieved nearly 100x acceleration
